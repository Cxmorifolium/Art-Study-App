# Introduction to ArtStudio

*It should really be renamed to Art Study*

## What Artstudio Does
ArtStudio helps decision paralysis artists, artblocks, or artist who doesn't want to think (like me) to organize and enhance their practice session by providing **limited** curated inspiration Whether you can't decide on the theme, palette, or visual, ArtStudio provides it all in one app! 

## Core Workflow

### 1. **Start a Study Session**

Choose between **Quick Sketch** (30 seconds to 30 minutes) for rapid practice, or **Session mode** (30min to 3 hours) for in-depth studies. The app generates random content for each session to keep your practice varied and challenging. Sometimes it might be vague-- you're going to have to come up with something. use that imagination juice!

### 2. **Get Inspired**

Every session provides:
- Visual References: High-quality images from Unsplash to draw from 
- Color Palettes: Mathematically harmonious color schemes using algorithms inspired by the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) (Check it out! It's really neat)
- Word Prompts: Curated combinations of themes, subjects, styles, and settings to spark creativity. 

### 3. Practice With Purpose

Use the integrated timer to stay focused. In Quick Sketch mode, the timer automatically generates new content when time expires, perfect for gesture drawing and thumbnailing sessions. Session mode gives you extended time with rich content. You do not have to use all the prompts given! Although bonus points if you do. Challenge yourself with what's in front of you!

### 4. Build Your Favorites

Found an inspiring image or perfect color scheme? Hit the heart button to save it to your personal collection! Your favorites are cached locally and can be reused in future sessions or when creating gallery entries.

### 5. Document Your Progress

After creating artwork, click the "Add" button in the Gallery to:
- Upload a photo of your finished piece
- Link them to the prompts, colors, and references you used
- Add personal notes about what you practices and future implementation
- Tag your work for easy searching later
